## Usability lessons

#### List 10 usability problems organized by high-level theme with criticality. 

Match the real world, 특정 하이라이트 경우는 두 팀 모두에게 해당되는 하이라이트인 상황도 생길 것 같다.

Match the real world, Tried to send message with pressing “enter” (C)

Match the real world, Expect league ranking on the main page. (A, C) (High)

Match the real world, Use some metaphor of LOL game client, to send invitation. (H)

User control & freedom, 퀴즈 정답을 누르면 바로 제출이 된다거나 제출이 되는 버튼이 있으면 좋을 것 같다. (A)

User control & freedom,  Making new timestamp by user seems less intuitive. (C) Offering candidate of timestamp from the website seems better.

Expect the timestamp go back to smaller shape after clicking it. (C) 

Error Prevention, Cannot deactivate already invited friends. (H)

Recognition rather than recall, Expected more specific information(title, hints to contents) when hover on a timestamp. (H)

Visibility, Aesthetic design, 

Unnatural main page blocks (A) / feel uncomfortable with position of private room. (C) / Expect friend list appears on the main page, and also the first entrance to private room. (H)

Visibility, Expect pop-up quiz to be located in top or bottom of screen to less bother watching game. (C)

Visibility, 친구초대 기능이 눈에 띄지 않는 것 같다. Expect friend invitation feature to be more visible. (A)

Visibility, 스케줄에 남은 경기는 날짜와 D-day 모두 표시되면 좋을 것 같고 지난 경기는 날짜가 적히면 좋을 것 같다. Looked for both date and D-day display for upcoming schedule, and both result and date showing for past games. (A)


Visibility of system status, 사람들 투표현황을 볼 수 있으면 좋을 것 같다. Expect other users’ voting status. (A)

Visibility of system status, 프라이빗 룸의 썸네일은 유저 프로필보다는 인게임 영상인게 더 좋을 것 같다. Expect in-game screenshot to be the thumbnails of private room. (A)
